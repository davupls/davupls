# 🧑‍💻 David Mclean | Aspiring Embedded & Performance-Oriented Software Engineer

Hi, I’m David — a field technician transitioning into systems-level software engineering.  
I’m currently focused on mastering **Modern C++** with an emphasis on **performance**,  
**embedded systems**, and **hardware-aware programming**.

---

## 🚀 Current Goals
- Complete the **12-week Modern C++ for AMD Roles** roadmap  
- Build a portfolio of optimized C++ projects:  
  CLI tools, multithreading, memory layout, GPU programming  
- Break into high-performance software roles at:  
  **AMD**, **Tesla**, **Lockheed Martin**, or **Qualcomm**

---

## 🛠️ Technologies I’m Working With
- **C++20/23**, STL, RAII, CMake  
- Linux, Clang/GCC, Git, Valgrind  
- CPU/GPU optimization (SIMD, HIP, CUDA – beginner level)  
- Learning: Multithreading, custom allocators, system-level profiling
