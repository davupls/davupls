🧑‍💻 David Mclean | Aspiring Embedded & Performance-Oriented Software Engineer

Hi, I’m David — a field technician transitioning into systems-level software engineering. I’m currently focused on mastering Modern C++ with an emphasis on performance, embedded systems, and hardware-aware programming.

🚀 Current Goals
	•	Complete the 12-week Modern C++ for AMD Roles roadmap
	•	Build a portfolio of optimized C++ projects (CLI tools, multithreading, memory layout, and GPU programming)
	•	Break into high-performance software roles at companies like AMD, Tesla, Lockheed Martin, or Qualcomm...

🛠️ Technologies I’m Working With
	•	C++20/23, STL, RAII, CMake
	•	Linux, Clang/GCC, Git, Valgrind
	•	CPU/GPU optimization (SIMD, HIP, CUDA - beginner level)
	•	Learning: Multithreading, Custom allocators, System-level profiling

📂 Featured Repos
	•	🧊 Celsius Converter — Week 1 mini-project (I/O, types, and arithmetic)
	•	⌛ Guessing Game (coming soon)
	•	💸 Bank Tracker (coming soon)
	•	📇 Contact Book CLI (coming soon)
